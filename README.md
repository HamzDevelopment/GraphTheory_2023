# Graph Theory Project 2023 | G00379404

This is a 3rd year project in ATU about the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

## Setup

We will need Jupyter in order to run the notebook, this is a package inside Python. So install Python, I recommend through [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). 

To run the notebook, navigate to the folder in a command prompt (cmd). Type `jupyter notebook`. If you have issues, then most likely python was not added to your path variables, look [here](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows) for more information.

Another way to run the notebook, is by just searching for juptyer in your search bar, if you installed Anaconda there should be an App called "Juypter Notebook (anaconda3)". One the browser loads up just navigate to the `graph_isomorphism.ipynb` file.

## Overview

The notebook contains the following.

- What is the Problem?
- Types of Graphs
- How to solve the problem?
